TJ's eighth period system is great, but the flexibility it offers can become a hassle when you're trying to wrap up a homework assignment during lunch. This is a fork of Iolite, which signs up for your preferred clubs automatically.

* Avoid wasting away lunch waiting for TJ servers to respond
* Reduce that server load - signs up for activities at random times well before day of
* Never “forget to sign up”
* Get spots in popular clubs as soon as they open- checks for new blocks and signs up once a day

UI requires some tweaking
